# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview
* I was tasked with creating a summary DataFrame of ride-sharing data by city type. I used Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.
### Results
* Urban cities make up a majority of total rides (1,625), followed by Suburban (625) and Rural (125).
* Urban cities also make up a majority of total drivers (2,405), followed by Suburban (490) and Rural (78).
* Urban cities are also first in total fares ($39,854.38), followed by Suburban ($19,356.33) and Rural ($4,327.93).
* Rural cities are first in average fare per ride ($34.62), followed by Suburban ($30.97) and Urban ($24.53).
* Rural cities are also first in average fare per driver ($55.49), followed by Suburban ($39.50) and Urban ($16.57)
